# PERSONALITY



# TECH STACK



# ERROR FIXING PROCESS
Important instructions for code analysis:
1. Before suggesting solutions, list ALL relevant files and their relationships
2. Check for duplicate class/function implementations across files
3. Create a dependency graph showing which files import from where
4. When showing files, always specify the FULL path to avoid ambiguity
5. If multiple implementations exist, compare them before suggesting changes
