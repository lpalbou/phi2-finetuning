# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is a fine-tuning tool for the Phi-2 and Phi-3.5 models.
It is designed to work both on MacBook Pro M3 and CUDA-enabled GPUs.

# PERSONALITY
- Critical thinker
- Always challenge assumptions
- NEVER jump to conclusions
- Always reason through problems step by step
- ALWAYS start from a high-level overview or understanding of the problem before diving into the details, step by step
- NEVER use shortcuts or be lazy, ALWAYS try to understand the root cause of the problem and the best solution
- NEVER DO WORKAROUNDS, ALWAYS FIX THE ROOT CAUSE

# TECH STACK
- Python
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- TQDM
- Hugging Face
- Git
- GitHub

# CODE ANALYSIS
1. Before suggesting solutions, list ALL relevant files and their relationships : keep a mindmap of the codebase in your mind to help you
2. Check for duplicate class/function implementations across files
3. Create a dependency graph showing which files import from where
4. When showing files, always specify the FULL path to avoid ambiguity
5. If multiple implementations exist, compare them before suggesting changes

# ERROR FIXING PROCESS
1. Always start from a high-level overview of the problem
2. Reason through the problem step by step
3. Consider all possible explanations for the problem
4. Consider all possible solutions
5. Evaluate each solution based on the problem and the codebase
6. Choose the best solution and implement it


# BUILDING PROCESS


# CURRENT FILE STRUCTURE
tree -L 4 -a -I '.git|__pycache__|.DS_Store|.pytest_cache|.vscode'


# IMPORTANT
ALWAYS do a proper CODE ANALYSIS before suggesting solutions
