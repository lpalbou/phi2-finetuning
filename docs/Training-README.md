# Training Guide

## Training Parameters

### Batch Processing
- `batch_size` (default: 8)
  - Number of samples processed together
  - Higher values = faster training, more memory
  - Lower values = slower training, less memory
  - Recommended range: 4-16

- `gradient_accumulation_steps` (default: 8)
  - Number of forward passes before updating weights
  - Lower values = faster training, more memory usage
  - Recommended range: 4-32

- `max_length` (default: 1024)
  - Maximum sequence length for inputs/outputs
  - Longer sequences = more memory usage
  - Should match your data requirements
  - Check your dataset's actual length requirements
  - Recommended: Use minimum required for your data

### Learning Parameters
- `learning_rate` (default: 2e-4)
  - Step size for model updates
  - Higher values = faster learning but risk instability
  - Lower values = more stable but slower training
  - Recommended range: 5e-5 to 2e-4

- `epochs` (default: 20)
  - Number of complete passes through the dataset
  - More epochs = better learning but risk overfitting
  - Fewer epochs = faster training but might underfit
  - Monitor validation loss to determine optimal value

- `warmup_ratio` (default: 0.05)
  - Portion of training spent increasing learning rate
  - Higher values = more stable start but slower training
  - Lower values = faster training but might be unstable
  - Recommended range: 0.03-0.1

### LoRA Parameters

- `lora_r` (default: 8)
  - Rank of LoRA adaptations
  - Higher values = more capacity but larger adapter
  - Lower values = smaller adapter but limited capacity
  - Recommended range: 8-32 depending on task complexity

- `lora_alpha` (default: 32)
  - Scaling factor for LoRA updates
  - Higher values = stronger adaptation effect
  - Lower values = more conservative changes
  - Usually set to 2x-4x of lora_r

- `lora_dropout` (default: 0.05)
  - Dropout probability in LoRA layers
  - Higher values = more regularization

### Example Configurations

1. **Balanced Training** (default):

## Memory Optimization

- **GPU Memory**: Ensure your GPU has sufficient memory for the model and data.
- **Batch Size**: Adjust the batch size to fit your GPU's memory.
- **Gradient Accumulation**: Use gradient accumulation to handle large batches without exceeding GPU memory.
